                childhood, I’ve always been captivated by the idea of computers.
                Hence, I can say that joining SiTE has been one of the most
                fulfilling experiences of my life.

                    the world around me. With every step, I feel the ground
                    beneath me, grounding my thoughts and emotions. The rhythm
                    of each stride seems to sync with the pulse of life itself.
                    It's a simple act that transcends its simplicity, inviting
                    me to witness the beauty that often escapes hurried gazes.

                I've been drawing things I observe since I was a child. I used

                quarantine that sparked my love for coding. Creating something

                find fascinating.

                As a kid, the piano was this huge, mysterious thing in the
                corner of the room. I'd press random keys, curious about the
                sounds they made. Slowly, with each lesson, those weird noises
                turned into songs. It was like solving a puzzle—I'd mess up a
                lot, but each mistake was a step closer to getting it right.
                Now, playing feels like second nature; those keys are like old
                friends, helping me tell stories without saying a word.
